This is an ios demo application using swift for calculating tip amount.
This is my second version. my first one (I didn't saw the video) and build the keyboard which was a little bit ffrustrating but also I felt like I learn a lot :)
In this version I follow the video but my setting page doesn't work becausse I couldn't create outlate from the second screen. I really hope that I can  learn that on the course.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total
